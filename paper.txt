Windows 95/NT 4.0 CD key
------------------------
Windows 95 or NT CD key contains normally 10 numbers. Structure of a 10 numbers length
CD key is like AAA-BCDEFFG where each of these characters represents their own respected
values. After calculation, all these keys have to merge together where the sum will be
calculated. Each individual value needs to be checked whether the generated key (sum)
is valid or not.

R = B + C + D + E + F + F + G

1. Using the mod-7 algorithm the sum of R must need to be dividable with 7 which will
result in the remainder of 0.
2. E must need to be equal or lower than 8.
3. G must not be 0 and must be lower than 8.

This ends up this simple equation and now we need the value of AAA, which actually can
be anything if it respects a few things.

AAA value must not be 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, or 999.

To simplify, you can add another rule to our previous note where
4. B must not be similar to C.
Which says that value B is not equal to C (e.g. 3 must not be 3, (B)3 != (C)3)
(Note, this only implies if you use BCD values as your AAA values. If you generate
your own values last two notes aren't enforced.)

An example key: 470-4706713

Windows 95/NT Workstation OEM key
---------------------------------
Several OEM-based Windows 95 disks were published back in the '90s. But in all of them, the
most popular was when NT came along. NT Workstation required OEM key instead typical
CD key.

An OEM key contains 20 characters (most of them are numbers except the keyword "OEM")
and without the "OEM" keyword itself, it only boils down to 17 numbers. To simplify the
work, we'll divide each of them into sections.

The structure of the key is, AAAAA-OEM-BCCCCCC-DDDDD

AAAAA - This section represents the date the key was printed on the copy of Windows.
The first three AAA can be anything from 001 to 366 (*1*) and the last section,
AA can be anything from 95 to 03. For Windows 95, this must be either 02 or 95 (*2*).

OEM - In Windows 95 we've to type the whole "OEM" keyword, by following "-OEM-". NT
Workstation doesn't require it and generally prints OEM where we only have to type the
OEM key.

BCCCCCC - This section where we've to apply the previous algorithm (as follows by the CD key)
with some exceptions.

R = B + C + C + C + C + C + C

1. B must needs to be 0.
2. C values must need to be dividable by 7 which will
result in the remainder of 0.

DDDDD - This section's values can be anything numeric. Windows doesn't check this portion.

This ends up with a similar but slightly different approach. Note that the values in BCCCCCC
not always have to be dividable by 7. Several reversed engineered sources showed that when
validating the key Windows does some trick (increment the value with 1 which then reiterate
for 6 times and then the last padding) until it becomes dividable by 7 and the remainder
becomes 0.

(*1*) - It was intended for leap-year, however, there is no confirmation news about this.
(*2*) - A modified or beta version may have a different key pair. If you're unsure whether
it will be 02 or 95, please try other keys, e.g. from 95 to 03, and see if it works.
